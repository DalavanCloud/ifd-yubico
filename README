== Yubico OS X libccid patcher
This repository contains scripts for building an installer for OSX that ensures
your system can detect and use CCID enabled YubiKeys. The way this is done
differs depending on what version of OS X you are running. Regardless of
version, you will most likely need to reboot the system after running the
installer for the system to pick up the changes.

=== OS X 10.10 and earlier
OS X ships with libccid, which supports all CCID enabled YubiKey devices.
However, it contains a whitelist of compatible devices, and the list that ships
with the OS is missing several entries that are needed for YubiKeys to be
detected. On these systems the ifd-yubico installer will patch the existing
list and add all needed entries.

=== OS X 10.11 (and later)
Due to the new "rootless" security feature of 10.11, it is no longer possible
to patch the existing libccid device list. Instead, the installer will install
a custom built version of libccid in parallel to the original one, with it's
own device list containing all YubiKey devices.

== Building the installer
If you're just looking for an installer to use, just download a pre-built one
from the releases page. If you want to build it yourself, first download the
following dependencies into the root directory of the repository, then run
./build-installer.sh. The resulting installer, ifd-yubico.pkg, will be created
in the output directory.

NOTE: You will need OS X 10.11 to build the installer.

=== Build dependencies
To build the installer you will need the source code for libusb 1.0.9 as well
as libccid 1.4.20. These are available from the following pages:

 http://www.libusb.org/
 https://alioth.debian.org/frs/?group_id=30105#title_ccid

You also need pkg-config, which can be installed using for example Homebrew.
